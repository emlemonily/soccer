# Soccer
## This is a folder of soccer “football” teams in the UEFA Champions League. This is Europe’s annual club football competition of top-division European teams. I chose to showcase five of these teams: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, Bayern Munich, and Paris Saint-Germain. Then, I decided to showcase five players on each team, providing their: ages, country of origin, position, jersey number, and a few fun facts. Rather than including a heavy emphasis on their specific achievements and championships won, I tried to include facts about their charity activities, personal lives, etc. to be a bit more fun.
